## How to Add Your Own Vocabulary

### Editing `vocabulary.json`

The `vocabulary.json` file contains all your vocabulary data. Here's the structure:

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "id": "cat1",
      "name": "Academic Writing",
      "description": "Words related to academic and formal writing"
    }
  ],
  "words": [
    {
      "id": "word1",
      "word": "meticulous",
      "definition": "Showing great attention to detail; very careful and precise",
      "category": "cat1",
      "relatedWords": ["careful", "thorough", "precise", "scrupulous"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Adding a New Category

1. Open `vocabulary.json`
2. Add a new object to the `categories` array:

```json
{
  "id": "cat4",
  "name": "Your Category Name",
  "description": "Category description"
}
```

### Adding a New Word

1. Open `vocabulary.json`
2. Add a new object to the `words` array:

```json
{
  "id": "word7",
  "word": "your-word",
  "definition": "Definition of the word",
  "category": "cat1",
  "relatedWords": ["synonym1", "synonym2", "related1"]
}
```

**Important:**
- Each `id` must be unique
- The `category` field should match an existing category's `id`
- `relatedWords` is an array of related terms or synonyms

## Tips for Best Experience

## Troubleshooting

### Words not showing up?
- Make sure `vocabulary.json` is in the same folder as `index.html`
- Check that the JSON syntax is valid (use a JSON validator online)
- Try using a local server instead of opening the file directly

### Notes not saving?
- Make sure cookies are enabled in your browser
- Check that you're not in incognito/private mode

### File not loading on some browsers?
- Use a local server (see "Getting Started" section)
- Some browsers restrict local file access for security
